Lab pt 1 - File is pythoWarmup.py


Lab pt 2 - File is pythoWarmup2.py


Lab pt 3 - File is camelCaseLab.py

The rest of the files are just a reference from my own practice and the video demo


Update 09-05-23: (READ "camelCaseLab.py" file for lab 3)
I have modified, added, and refactored code in the camel case program for lab 3.

Changes:
1. I refactored the camel case program to add a main method to separate and chunk individual functions to put outside. This allows them to call their functions inside the main method and also add future functions that do not overlap with each other in one space.
2. I have added 2 mini features at the start of the program, a banner and instructions for users to see and display on their terminals. These are both separate functions with their docstrings explaining what they do.
3. Separated other Python practice files and previous lab 1 work into a folder called, "PythonPractice" besides Camel Case Program.
4. Added a .gitignore and added .vsscode file in there.
